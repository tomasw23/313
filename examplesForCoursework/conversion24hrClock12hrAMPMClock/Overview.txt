This file contains multiple versions of the clock example.
See the README.txt file for information why regarding that this is a simplified 
version of the conversion from 24 hr to 12 hr and why we use this simplified
version.



vers01onlyAdaNoMainAdbFile
   This version has no main.adb file. 
   It can be compiled, which creates files which can
   be linked from other programs, but it has no main file to be executed.
   It contains just the package clock in clock.ads and clock.adb which defines
   the procedure carrying out the conversion.

vers02OnlyAdaWithIOWithMainAdbFile
   Adds a main.adb file to vers01onlyAdaNoMainAdbFile
   This can be compiled to create an executable file main 

vers03UsingAsLibrary
   Replaces the usage of Ada input/output functions by the As_Library
   which allows data/information flow analysis in SPARK Ada.
   
vers04WithAddedRanges
   Adds types which are range restricted to vers03UsingAsLibrary.

vers05WithRecordType
   Adds a record type to vers04WithAddedRanges

vers06WithFunction
   Adds a function to vers05WithRecordType
   Note: In previous versions function occurred in all previous version
   We removed the function from vers01* - vers05*  since in the coursework 
   we usually have more than one output, and a function can only be defined
   after a record type was created which bundles the outputs into one output.

vers07withDependsClauses
    Adds to vers06WithFunction  depends clauses so that
    the code passes the information flow

vers08withVerificationConditions
    Adds verification conditions to the example. Passes verification in 
    SPARK Ada

vers09optionalWithProcedureOfInput
    This is an optional version, since some students wanted to use a procedure
    for reading the inputs, in order to avoid repetitive code.

    It is desirable to make these inputs via a procedure, but not required 
    in the coursework since dealing with Standard_Input and Standard_Output 
    is a more advanced feature, and the focus of the coursework 1 is to
    learn the basics of SPARK Ada.
