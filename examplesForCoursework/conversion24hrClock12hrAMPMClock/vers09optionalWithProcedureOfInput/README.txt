This is a version where the input in the main file is done via
  a procedure Get_Hour defined in io_package.adb
  which has the depends clauses required referring to Standard_Input and
  Standard_Output.


This Version is not required for the coursework in CSCM13/313 in 2023/24.
  It was added since some students wanted to carry out repeated inputs via a 
  procedure. 
  It is desirable to make these inputs via a procedure, but not required 
  in the coursework since dealing with Standard_Input and Standard_Output 
  is a more advanced feature, and the focus of the coursework 1 is to
  learn the basics of SPARK Ada.
