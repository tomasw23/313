Commands for cloning the git repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cd
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://bitbucket.org/anton_setzer/criticalhighintegritysystems.git

Starting Setup script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Copy the file in this directory of the git repository

setupScriptLinuxLabGnatstudio.sh
to
~/Downloads

Make it executable by changing
    properties -> Permissions -> Tick "Allow Executing file as program"
Then in a terminal execute

cd ~/Downloads/
./setupScriptLinuxLabGnatstudio.sh

Change preferences in gnatstudio for execute command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vers 1: Solutions once xterm is installed (probably from 18 Oct 2024 onwards)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to
gnatstudio -> edit -> preferences -> External commands -> at right side change
xterm -hold -e

to
xterm -hold

Then once you have compiled a program
(by selecting the main.adb file and using
 Build -> Project -> Build <current file> )
Use
Build -> Run -> Custom
tick both
  Run in executables directory
  Run in external terminal
It should show as command (you might need to choose from the
   drop down menu one of the other commands)
xterm -e
If that works then execute it.
A terminal will open.
To run the main file execute
./main

Solution if this doesn't work (Vers1 )
---------------------------------------
Some problems might occur for instance if you used Vers2 before
  and switched back to Vers1 (as recommended)
In this case
xterm -e
doesn't show up directly as command to be execued.

You might need to do the following:
Look from the dropdown menu any of the options which displays
  an expression starting with
  %external [exec_dir]
Delete everything following this command
  (which could be some code changing the environment, so containing
   ENV )
Once you deleted this in the bottom menu
xterm -e
should appear
Now continue as before.
SPARK Ada should remember your solution and next time you just
open it directly execute it and then type in the terminal which opens
./main




Vers 2: Solution which works without xterm (Obsolete)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This solution is now obsolete since xterm is installed in the Linux
Lab. It is kept here in case this problem reappears.

Go to
gnatstudio -> edit -> preferences -> External commands -> at right side change
xterm -hold -e

to
env DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=%(env:DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS) gnome-terminal -- bash -c ./main;bash


Then once you have compiled a program
(by selecting the main.adb file and using
 Build -> Project -> Build <current file> )
Use
Build -> Run -> Custom
Untick both
  Run in executables directory
  Run in external terminal

Then press return
gnome-shell should open
